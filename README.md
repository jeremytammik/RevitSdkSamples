# RevitSdkSamples

Revit SDK Documentation and Samples.

This repository was created in order to make the official Revit SDK available online, especially to enable adding it to
the [ApiDocs.co code search sample collection](https://github.com/gtalarico/apidocs.samples) to provide sample code for
the [Apidocs.co API documentation pages](https://apidocs.co).
